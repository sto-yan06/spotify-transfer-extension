# Spotify Playlist Transfer
#### Description: Transform your "Liked songs" playlist in Spotify to a new standalone, identical (if needed) playlist. 

##### In order to use the Chrome Web Extension, you must be logged in into your Spotify account. Otherwise it would not work. 

##### Once you're logged in, you can select all of your songs, or just those you want and transfer them into another playlist that already exists, or insert the name of your playlist that you want to create. 

##### Either write a name for your playlist and then it will create a new one. Or select from those that already exists. 

### BE CAREFUL ! THE TEXT BOX MUST REMAIN EMPTY IN CASE YOU WANT TO INSERT INTO AN ALREADY EXSISTING PLAYLIST!
